### Usage

1. Add this theme to Trilium, follow the link https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Themes.
2. Upload fonts in `./fonts` folder to your Trilium, add them to custom resources by adding attributes like `#customResourceProvider="theme/alkaid/fonts/SourceHanSansCN-Regular.otf`.
3. Upload your avatar as `avatar.png`, and add attributes `#customResourceProvider="theme/alkaid/avatar.png`.
4. In order to optimize the reading experience of Chinese notes, I added some CSS style for the CK Editor. If you don't like it, just delete the style inside block `CK-Editor`.
